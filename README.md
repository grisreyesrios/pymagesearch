Computer Vision is according to Wikipedia and other sources a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers to see and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.

It is a multidisciplinary field that can be considered as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning where specialized methods and general learning algorithms are used.

According to **Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference (2012)**:

> The goal of computer vision is to extract useful information from images. This has proved a surprisingly challenging task; it has occupied thousands of intelligent and creative minds over the last four decades, and despite this, we are still far from being able to build a general-purpose "seeing machine".

With this in mind and after working on some computer vision projects, I realize the importance to enter and deep into this field, as long with the passion that I discover for it. Based on this, I decided to become proficient in the field. 
As a first step, I decided to create these self-made tutorials series and projects regarding Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning based on the wonderful courses developed by [Adrian Rosebrock "PyImageSearch University"](https://pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-university/).

The main work of these was based on the course materials and my work. Since I am a strong believer in open source, I hope these series help you on starting in Computer Vision with the powerful [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), as it has being helping me.

## 1) OpenCV 101
